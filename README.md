# Facial Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

I'm excited to share my facial recognition project, developed entirely by me. The goal of this project is to create an image classifier capable of recognizing my face using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

## Project Structure

The project consists of four main files:

- **app.py**: The core code for the CNN model.
- **prime_model**: The model saved with the best parameters for face classification.
- **test.py**: A framework for testing the model in real-world scenarios.
- **deploy.py**: Implementation of the facial recognition model for use in Discord.

## Project Objective

The original goal was to develop a facial recognition model for unlocking my computer. However, due to complications with Windows integration, the focus shifted to deploying the model in the Discord app.

## Final Thoughts

I believe that such a model could be implemented in a more flexible operating system.
